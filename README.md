Absolutely! Here are some insightful questions an analyst might have asked before creating the visualizations to ensure the analysis was meaningful and accurate:

### **Data Understanding Questions**
1. **What is the main objective of this analysis?**  
   ➔ (Identifying trends, outliers, or patterns in customer behavior or sales performance)  

2. **What type of data am I working with?**  
   ➔ (Categorical, numerical, or time series data?)  

3. **Are there any missing values or data inconsistencies that need cleaning?**  
   ➔ (Are 'None' or 'N/A' considered valid entries or errors?)  


### **📊 Data Distribution & Outlier Questions**
4. **What is the overall distribution of my data?**  
   ➔ (Is the data normally distributed or skewed?)  

5. **Are there any potential outliers that could distort my analysis?**  
   ➔ (Should I use IQR or Z-score to identify them?)  

### **📈 Performance & Trend Analysis**
6. **What key metrics should I focus on?**  
   ➔ (Average sales, conversion rates, or customer retention?)  

7. **Are there any seasonal trends or cyclical patterns?**  
   ➔ (Are there spikes during holidays or special events?)  

### **🔍 Data Profiling & Segmentation**
8. **Which data segments are important to highlight?**  
   ➔ (Should I compare by region, age group, or customer type?)  

9. **What relationships between variables should I explore?**  
   ➔ (Does customer spending vary by demographics?)  

### **📌 Visualization Design**
10. **Which visualization type best represents this data?**  
   ➔ (Bar chart for comparisons, line chart for trends, pie chart for proportions?)  

11. **What key insights should the audience take away from this visual?**  
   ➔ (Should the chart emphasize growth, gaps, or high-risk areas?)
